## Day 08 | January 21, 2020 | Tuesday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about a special case of the relationship between two quantitative variables is the linear relationship. In this case, a straight line simply and adequately summarizes the relationship. When the scatterplot displays a linear relationship, we supplement it with the correlation coefficient (r). The least-squares regression line has the smallest sum of squared vertical deviations of the data points from the line. Extrapolation is the prediction of values of the explanatory variable that falls outside the range of the data.

**Description:** Following topics were covered:
- Case Q → Q: Linear Relationships
  - Introduction
  - Correlation
    - R - Coefficient of Correlation
    - Properties of R

## Day 04 | January 17, 2020 | Friday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned that the range covered by the data is the most intuitive measure of spread and is exactly the distance between the smallest data point (min) and the largest one (Max). Another measure of spread is the inter-quartile range (IQR), which is the range covered by the middle 50% of the data. The IQR can be used to detect outliers using the 1.5(IQR) criterion. Outliers are observations that fall below Q1 - 1.5(IQR) or above Q3 + 1.5(IQR). The five-number summary of distribution consists of the median (M), the two quartiles (Q1, Q3) and the extremes (Min, Max). The standard deviation measures the spread by reporting a typical (average) distance between the data points and their average.

**Description:** These includes the following topics:
- One Quantitative Variable: Measure of Spread
  - Range
  - Inter-Quartile Range
    - Using IQR to detect outliers
